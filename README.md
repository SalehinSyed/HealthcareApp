# Healthcare App

Welcome to the Blinx Health Survey, a streamlined application designed to gather and manage health-related information efficiently. This application is built using React with TypeScript, leveraging the robustness of React Hook Form and the utility-first styling of Tailwind CSS to deliver a responsive and user-friendly interface.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Health Surveys:** Users can fill out a questionnaire based on their current health condition, with questions dynamically adjusting based on previous answers (e.g., showing additional fields if a chronic condition is selected).
- **Real-Time Validation:** Forms are validated in real-time using React Hook Form to ensure all data entered is accurate before submission, reducing the likelihood of errors and incomplete entries.
- **Responsive Design:** Tailwind CSS ensures that the survey is accessible and visually coherent across all devices and screen sizes.

## Local Development

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can download and install them from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the Repository
   `git clone https://github.com/SalehinSyed/HealthcareApp`

2. Install Dependencies
   `npm install`

3. Start the Development Server
   `npm start`

This runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

Running Tests

To run tests, use the following command:
 `npm test`

Executes the test runner in the interactive watch mode. For more information, see the section about running tests in the Create React App documentation.

This launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

Building for Production
